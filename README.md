#Mouse Button Swapper

"Mouse Button Swapper" is a Windows application that allows you to quickly swap mouse button (left <-> right). This option is normally available in Control Panel, but I needed quick access to it. I use the mouse with my left hand and during code inspections or ping pong programming I had to swap the buttons many times for my colleagues. It was annoying, hence this application.

*Features:*

* swap mouse button with double click (with any button) on system tray icon
* system tray icon context menu
* global hotkey
* run on startup

*Requirements:*

* to run exe: Windows with .NET 2.0
* to code: this is Visual Studio 2010 solution
